# LexiLoom - A Chinese Idiom Learning Platform
## Background

Our project is an interactive Chinese idiom learning platform designed to make learning idioms engaging and effective. Users can explore idioms through pinyin, meanings, and the explanation of each character. Real-time word battles and self-testing features further reinforce learning through competition and practice.

When the user clicks on the card, it would flip over, dispalying the literal meaning and explanation. When a user hovers over one character, the explanation of each character would show up.
